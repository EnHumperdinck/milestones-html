    Look at the following:
  </p>
  <p>
    Want to search the web?
    Try <a href="https://google.com" id="the-best-link" class="banana"  target="_blank">Google</a>!
  </p>
  <p>
    This looks like this in html code:
  </p>
  <p>
    &lt;p&gt;
    Try
    &lt;a href="https://google.com" id="the-best-link" class="banana"  target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;!
    &lt;/p&gt;
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are some resources to help you with each tag:
  </p>
  <p>
    For
    <a
    href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_p.asp"
    id="plink1"
    class="banana"
    target="_blank">&lt;p&gt;
  </a>.
    Also try
    <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p"
    id="plink2"
    class="banana"
    target="_blank">&lt;p&gt;
  </a>.

  </p>
  <p>
    For
    <a
    href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp"
    id="alink2"
    class="banana"
    target="_blank">&lt;a&gt;
  </a>.
    Also try
    <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a"
    id="alink2"
    class="banana"
    target="_blank">&lt;a&gt;
  </a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since &lt;a&gt; is inside &lt;p&gt;, this means that &lt;a&gt; is a child of &lt;p&gt;
  </p>
  <p>
    &lt;p&gt; means that it opens a paragraph. As a result, it must be closed, which is what
     &lt;/p&gt; does.
  </p>
  <p>
    &lt;a&gt; means that a hyperlink is opened, and it also has to be closed, which
     &lt;/a&gt; does.
  </p>
  <p>
    The attributes in the aforementioned line of code relate to &lt;a&gt;, and they are
    href, id, class, target.
  </p>
  <p>
    The attribute href is linked to the value "https://google.com", and it is a hypertext
    reference, or a link to another page, the URL of such.
  </p>
  <p>
    The attribute id is linked to the value "the-best-link", and it is a unique id for that element,
    useful for when we want to change certain aspects of it in the style section (css sheet)
  </p>
  <p>
    The attribute class is linked to the value "banana", and it is also an identifier like id,
    but instead it allows for the creation of a class of "classmates", so you can have multiple
    elements inside a class and change their styles all at once on the style sheet.
  </p>
  <p>
    The attribute target is linked with the value "blank", and target decides what happens when
    the hyperlink is clicked, and where the new page appears/how it will appear. The value of blank
    means that it is going to open up the hyperlinked page in a new window or tab.
