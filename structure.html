<h1>
  This is the header using the h1 tag.
</h1>
<p>
    In order seperate our website into different spaces, we can use
    h1 in the part of our body to divide our website under headers.
    from then on we can use p to create pargraphs of text in said headers.
</p>
<p>
    This is a second paragraph, using another p header. Notice how it is spaced
    automatically when you open and close a new p section.
</p>


<h2>
  This is a header using the h2 tag.
</h2>
  <p>
    Inside header2, this is the first paragraph that is made using a new p tag.
    Once again, it will be automatically spaced with another paragraph if a
    new p tag is called. We will notice that the text in the header h2 is smaller
    than the text in h1, because of the header hierarchy.
  </p>

  <p>
   This is the new paragraph, made by calling on a new p tag after the former one has
   been called.
